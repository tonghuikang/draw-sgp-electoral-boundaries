### The special case of Singapore

#### Polling districts. Residents on the same side of the street vote for the same party.

#### GRC and SMC. Public housing policy enforces the mixing of the various races of Singapore. While this reduces racial enclaves in Singapore, existing racial biases provide an advantage to the Chinese majority race. Therefore GRCs were instituted which require each GRC to field one minority candidate. 

The number and size of GRC is somewhat decided by the ruling party. (talk about history)
