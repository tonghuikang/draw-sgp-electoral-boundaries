We want good electoral boundaries.

But we need to agree on what is meant by "better" - and numerically model this.


# Modelling drawing electoral boundaries as an assignment problem

(describe)


# Measuring the goodness of polling district assignment

()


I elaborate on the measure in this file.


# Best and worst drawn electoral boundaries

(markdown table here)


# Better electoral boundaries according the the measure

(include image here)

Note that this is not the best possible boundaries.

I welcome contributions.
