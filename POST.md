Please tell whether the place names listed for your polling district is accurate and exhaustive.
Currently it is based on the nearest MRT.
I am planning to include road names (e.g. if you live along East Coast Road you are considered to be in East Coast).

The electoral boundaries may look weird.
This is because of the boundaries of the polling districts do not exactly match the adjacent districts.

If you want to draw on your electoral boundaries, feel free to fork the repository and write your own assignment.
I might want to run a small contest, but this is after I have finalized the scoring method.
